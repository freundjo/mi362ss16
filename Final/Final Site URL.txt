I completed the three required items by hosting my site on heroku, using freeDNS for my custom domain, and making it high quality work.

for my other points:

4 complete html pages with content - I have four pages to my site: the homepage, about me, professional, and contact me.

custom css/bootstrap for design - I use bootstrap on all of my pages to style my website.

Two custom images - I have three custom images that are on a carousel for my homepage, you are able to click through the pictures.

Javascript compononet - I have a welcome message display at the top of the homepage

Non heroic 3rd party app - I used AddThis to display a container for the follow me links on the top of the homepage

3rd party font - I used Font Awesome for the file icon on the contact me page
