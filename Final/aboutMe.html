			<h3>Background Info</h3>
			
			<p>I am a soon to be graduate of Michigan State University. I am grduating with a degree in Media and
				Information with a specialization in Interactive and Social Media. I enjoy everything related to MSU
				especially football and basketball which I have gotten student tickets to every year that I have 
				been a student. I grew up with Michigan State University in my backyard so it was always my dream of
				going to school here.</p>
			
			<p>When I'm not in class I enjoy playing sports and hanging out with friends. I have grown up playing
				basketball and golf so if i have free time there's a good chance im playing one of those. I also enjoy
				programming in my free time and staying up to date on the latest technology news. Recently I have begun
				teaching myself how to code in Swift to create iOS apps.</p>
